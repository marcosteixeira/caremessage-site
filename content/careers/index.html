<p class=career-sub>CareMessage uses technology to address challenges for society's most vulnerable populations. Over 86% of low income individuals in the US have access to a basic cell phone with messaging capabilities, making it one of the great social equalizers of our time. CareMessage's technology enables healthcare and social services agencies to better communicate and engage with their beneficiaries using mobile technology, improving overall health outcomes and dramatically reducing cost of care. We're growing at a staggering rate and want to work with the absolute best. Come change the world and make a real impact on healthcare!</p>

<h1 class="hero-left-1 hero-left-career"><strong>Working at CareMessage</strong></h1>
<p class=career-sub>Throughout the United States, millions of people struggle with chronic illnesses that inhibit their ability to live fulfilling, productive, and healthy lives. These chronic diseases, such as Type 2 diabetes, obesity, and heart disease, disproportionately affect low income populations that often lack the resources and knowledge required to adequately manage their health.</p>
<p class=career-sub>At CareMessage, we are on a mission to alleviate the burden of chronic illness by leveraging a technology that nearly everyone has in their pocket -- SMS text messaging. We accomplish this through our innovative online platform, which allows patients to receive clinically-designed disease education programs and health-related reminders right on their cell phones.</p>
