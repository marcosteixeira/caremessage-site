<h1 class="hero-left-1 hero-left-career"><strong>Working at CareMessage</strong></h1>
<p class=career-sub>Throughout the United States, millions of people struggle with chronic illnesses that inhibit their ability to live fulfilling, productive, and healthy lives. These chronic diseases, such as Type 2 diabetes, obesity, and heart disease, disproportionately affect low income populations that often lack the resources and knowledge required to adequately manage their health.</p>
<p class=career-sub>At CareMessage, we are on a mission to alleviate the burden of chronic illness by leveraging a technology that nearly everyone has in their pocket -- SMS text messaging. We accomplish this through our innovative online platform, which allows patients to receive clinically-designed disease education programs and health-related reminders right on their cell phones.</p>

<p class=career-sub>Our programs and reminders have huge benefits for both patients and the healthcare workers that serve them. Patients benefit from a better understanding of their chronic illness, and improved adherence to medication and appointment schedules. This empowers patients take control of their health through behavior changes and better disease self-management. Healthcare systems benefit by reducing missed appointments, and helping workers automate time-consuming tasks. This helps reduce costs and increase efficiency, allowing resource-constrained free clinics to do more with less.</p>
<p class=career-sub>We see this technology as a huge win-win for everyone involved in the healthcare system, and envision CareMessage becoming part of the healthcare industry's standard of care. Since being founded at Stanford University and incubated at Y Combinator, we have been growing fast. In the past two years, we have partnered with more than 50 healthcare organizations across 16 states, which serve more than 100,000 patients. Our goal is to impact 50 million lives over the next five years, and help reduce billions of dollars in unnecessary healthcare costs.</p>
