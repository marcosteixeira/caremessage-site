    <h3>Create Patient Profiles</h3>
    <p>Your first step will be to create patient profiles on CareMessage, all
    you need is a communication method (mobile or landline phone number) and a
    language preference (English or Spanish). Our system can detect if the phone
    number provided is in fact a mobile or landline number and can help you
    optimize your messaging to reach patients how they want to be messaged.</p>

    <div class="product-steps-number">2</div>
    <h3>Engage Patients</h3>
    <p>Contact patients for the first time by welcoming them when their profile is
    created, or send a mass message when you are ready to launch. Our system
    allows you to send one-to-one or one-to-many messages. We automatically
    handle the opt-out process for those patients that decide they no longer
    wish to receive messages.</p>

    <p>You can schedule messages for your patients on an ongoing basis. From
    appointment to preventive care reminders, our system can automate ongoing
    engagement. Our team offers a library of preventive care and health campaign
    messages that are pre-translated and reviewed by clinicians to meet national
    clinical guidelines.</p>

    collect data and help your patients improve their disease self-management
    skills. Our programs are written and reviewed by clinical staff and are
    designed to address holistic mental and physical health. They address the

    <h3>Reporting &amp; Follow Up</h3>
    <p>Measure the effectiveness of your messages through our various analytics
    tools. You can learn from your population and optimize your messaging to
    drive results. You can follow up by using our automated triggers or target
    specific populations based on their responses. Data on your CareMessage
    account is always available for download. Our dashboard provides metrics so
    that you can easily see how patients are interacting with your messages, so
    you always know how it’s working.</p>
