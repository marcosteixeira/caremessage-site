    <p>University of Alabama at Birmingham researchers conducted a randomized

    non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Patients were randomized to
    receiving text messages through CareMessage program in one arm and no text
    message in the other arm. All the patients received standard of care with
    instructions in the clinic on healthy diet and daily exercise for weight
    loss. The CareMessage program was aligned with the Health Belief Model and
    sent patients motivating content related to nutrition, exercise and stress
    management along with educational messages about NAFLD. After six months,
    compared to standard of care, intervention group lost more weight (11.2 vs.
    1.6 lbs., P=0.034) with much more decrease in ALT levels (20 vs. 8 units,
    P=0.043).</p>

    medication) and enrolled in CareMessage’s High Cholesterol program for 20
