    <p>Healthcare providers want to provide quality care in an efficient and
      cost-effective way, but staffing constraints and traditional methods often leave
      providers ill-equipped. Caring for their patient populations, particularly those
      disproportionately affected by poor health outcomes, can seem like an added
      burden to their already constrained schedules.</p>

    <p>New health technologies are often designed with the assumption that all users
      are alike, have access to technology, are English language speakers, and are
      able to allocate resources to their health. This one-size-fits-all approach is
      not working. We envision a world where we empower healthcare organizations to
      deliver high quality healthcare, regardless of location or resources, while
      improving outcomes for all patients.</p>

      <p>In the United States, low-income and less educated individuals use text
      messaging 2-4 times more than those of a higher income or higher education
      level. Text messages have a 98% open rate, making them a more effective
      mode of communication than email or patient portals. CareMessage customers
      have found over 85% of their patients have unlimited text messaging.</p>

          blood sugar and use his insulin on a consistent basis. I offered to set up the
          text to send him messages three times a day for two weeks, to see if we could
          get a routine established. He agreed. Today I called him to see how that was
          going. He said ‘I have not missed one time with your texts. I even hurried up to
          get it done last night so I could beat the text. Thanks for helping me with
          this, I feel better and my sugar is better.’”</p>
